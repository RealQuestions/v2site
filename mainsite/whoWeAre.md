We provide a way for people to ask questions of political leaders. We also provide a record of what the public wants to know, whether or not they receive an answer. We enable users to develop effective questions, and show the extent of user support for them. The key focus of our site is getting agreement amongst our users on key questions to politicians, through our discussions pages.
The vision of Real Questions is to improve political accountability through a website that allows people to engage with each other online to create effective questions to all elected politicians in Australia.

**Who is "Real Questions"?**

Real Questions is a non-profit organisation, legally registered as a company limited by guarantee in March 2010; the ABN is 43 142 636 093. It was started by Charles and David Jago, who have a background of involvement in public participation and facilitation. Funding (mostly for legal and accounting costs) is paid by the Jago family. No salaries are paid - we are all volunteers.

There are currently three people on the board: Charles, David and Jack Jago. Within the coming year, we intend that Real Questions will be led by a board of respected, transparently independent group of men and women from a range of occupational and political backgrounds, Australian states and age groups. It will include people with experience in social &/or political participation, media, politics (as former elected representatives, ideally covering multiple levels of government) as well as business and project management.

**We are all volunteers!**

Real Questions has no paid staff, and is entirely operated by volunteers. The project relies entirely on volunteers. Also, we don't have an office. Real Questions operates substantially as a virtual organisation. We have volunteers in mostly Sydney, but also in Brisbane. We use Skype for regular meetings, but get together in person about once a month.

The main form of revenue for the venture is expected to be website advertising, supported by some individual donations. No corporate donations will be accepted. However, grants from non-corporate organisations such as foundations may be accepted where the board believes that they do not compromise the independence of Real Questions.

Note: Charles Jago is a member of the Greens, but Real Questions is not associated with the Greens in any way. As stated above, it is anticipated that the board for Real Questions will also include people from other party backgrounds and perspectives (but not serving politicians or paid political operators). Real Questions will remain strongly independent.

The site is now complete, although we are working to improve a lot of its features, and improve quality. Our current focus is building an online community around the site.
