            <p><strong>Q: How does the Real Questions site work?</strong></p>

<p>A: Real Questions enables users to ask questions of politicians, with each question addressed to an individual politician and tracked separately. All questions are quite short (2-3 sentences max) and directed to a specific politician. Questions need to be supported by other users (the minimum level of support required is currently 10 users) to be emailed through to the politician.
Real Questions tracks each question, topic and politician separately. The site shows the numbers of questions to each politician, average ratings on questions (and answers if they are given), the number of comments on questions and answers, and average scores of politicians. The Scorecard compares the performance of politicians.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How is Real Questions different to other political websites?</strong></p>

<p>A: Political websites frequently focus on blogs or petitions. There are also comments on articles by the major media. Real Questions is different in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Our site has short questions rather than longer articles. This is different to the approach of a site with blog posts or longer user comments that link different issues together and are usually less specific. (Real Questions also has a place to put background info to the question).</li>
  <li>Rather than making a commentary to the world in general, questions are directed to a specific politician.</li>
  <li>The site tracks users’ support for each question, and shows the most popular questions, sorted by standard tags. This is different to commentary which offers an author’s views.</li>
  <li>The site tracks politicians’ quantity and quality (measured by user satisfaction) of responses to questions.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Q: Accountability is great objective, but how do you expect to make a difference?</strong></p>

<p>We make a difference when we can clearly demonstrate people’s concerns that aren’t reflected in the political “spin” created to control rather than respond to people’s concerns. At its most obvious, this might be a question supported by a thousand people, on a topic which is not acknowledged by relevant politicians. However, showing what people are concerned about on a wide range of concerns is also important, even if there are fewer questions involved.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the point in finding new ways to attack politicians?</strong></p>

<p>That’s definitely not what we are trying to do. Where politicians brazenly retreat to slogans and half-truths, then by all means we are happy for our members to state that strongly, with targeted questions on the weak points. Or equally, more detail on positive areas worth highlighting.
Politicians know that they don’t agree with every single aspect of their party’s policies, and they have to work with that as best they can. We don’t want to let them off the hook. But its about the substance, not attacking somebody. In Real Questions, we want to support useful discussion on the issues.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do you expect to get real answers when politicians simply repeat the party line in parrot fashion?</strong></p>

<p>This is a real issue with different answers at different levels. It is clear that there is little point in asking a question of a backbencher about a policy when he is not the spokesperson for that portfolio. That is a good reason to effectively direct questions to the people with responsibility for that area. However, you may want to ask more specific targeted questions for backbenchers or others outside their area of responsibility. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>[Mr Backbencher], what steps have you taken in your electorate to try to resolve [some specific issue].</li>
  <li>[Ms Minister in unrelated portfolio], what has your department done to contribute to [some area related but with overlapping or unclear line of authority].</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to avoid asking questions that a politician absolutely cannot answer, for reasons beyond their control: they will probably then just ignore you.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the difference between the discussions pages and the forums on the site?</strong></p>

<p>The discussions pages are the core of the site. The questions on the site get asked from and tracked through the discussions pages,  Yes, we also have forums, but these are for more general discussions. Send us a message on the contact page if you would like us to set up a new forum on a particular topic.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How do users evaluate other users’ questions?</strong></p>

<p>A: Users rate other users’ questions on two dimensions: clear expression (clarity) and support. Clarity is rated out of five, while support is yes or no. We want users to select the best questions, which are those which are best expressed AND get the highest level of support.</p>

<p>A question which sounds very clever might get a high score for clarity.  However, that does not mean people agree with it, because it might express a minority view. It might only receive a low level of support.</p>

<p>When the questions are sorted, the clearest and most relevant questions go to the top.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How much support does a question have to get before it is sent to a politician?</strong></p>

<p>A: Initially, we are asking each question to be supported by four other people before it is sent to a politician asking them to answer it. That means every question should be supported by at least ten people. This looks like a reasonable request which any good question should be able to achieve while we are building up the site. We can call this the “minimum bar” for questions. Over time, we expect to review and probably increase the minimum bar.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  How can I get more support for my question?</strong></p>

<p>First, make sure you look at similar questions. If your question simply duplicates or is close to somebody else’s, then adding another one will likely confuse people rather than gain their support. If you want to submit a question that improves on another question, make sure you mention this. You can put your explanation in the background field of your new question. You can also make comments on other questions. You could also send a message to another user. Or you could start a new forum to discuss the topic more generally.</p>

<p><strong>Q:  Why can’t questions be longer?</strong></p>

<p>The questions allow around 255 characters each for the question and the same again for a background explanation, which is enough for a succinct question, and even links if need be. The questions are not designed to be a forum where people write paragraphs or an essay; they are designed to capture key concerns, each quite specific. We also have forums where people can write longer topics. Send us a message if you want us to start a new forum on a particular topic.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Do you expect that politicians will actually answer the questions?</strong></p>

<p>A: Having the politicians actually answer would be icing on the cake, but that’s obviously not reliable! The key thing is to have a collectively developed set of what our users think are the key questions. The questions directed to each politician will obviously evolve over time. They will also improve as users see how they can create new questions which improve in various ways on the existing ones, to be clearer and better targeted.</p>

<p><strong>Q: But do you actually want answers?</strong></p>

<p>A: Yes, we will actually be asking for answers. Emails will go to politicians, asking them to answer the list of current questions to them, where those questions have enough support from users. All answers will be posted on the website, so that users can see it and rate them for clarity and relevance, just like the questions. This will feed into the score of each politician.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What about answers which might already exist?</strong></p>

<p>A: If we don’t have an answer directly from a politician, and somebody sees a direct answer already available (such as in an article online) they will be able to post a link for that. We will then use the same rating process - but these features are not yet implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Isn’t it likely that some people will “game” the site to bias the questions toward a particular party or viewpoint?</strong></p>

<p>A: While the site will be available for anonymous browsing, only registered users who are real people will be able contribute to the site. The site will then reflect their opinions. Obviously, we want that membership to be as broad as possible!</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why do I have to provide my name, address and phone number to register?</strong></p>

<p>A: It is important that everybody contributing to the site is a real person, and that their contribution is valued equally. The scoring or voting of questions and comments on the site makes no sense if people can vote more than once. We ask for details so that we can check if necessary. (This information is confidential - see our privacy policy.)</p>

<p><strong>Q: Am I completely anonymous when I ask questions or make comments online?</strong></p>

<p>A: A user’s full name is not shown on the site unless that is part of the user name registered with Real Questions. However, you remain responsible for what you say on the site - see our terms of use and privacy policy.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Who controls the code for the website?</strong></p>

<p>A: All code making up the website is available free of charge under open source licences at Github. (This does not include any of the data, and especially no personal data.) The Drupal code is licenced under the “GPL v2 or later” licence. Drupal is an open source content management system. Our additional code is licenced under the GNU Affero General Public licence v3..</p>

<p><strong>Q: Why would politicians participate when they are very shy in answering questions?</strong></p>

<p>A: See the page FAQ for politicians.</p>

<p>(Please send any additional questions via the contact page.)</p>
