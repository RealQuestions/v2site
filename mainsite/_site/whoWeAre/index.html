	 Real Questions aims to harness online public participation to generate increased

	political accountability, presenting the concerns of the public, including questions to 

	politicians. Real Questions is an innovative, open and capable non-profit 

	organisation which continues to evolve and grow. All staff in the organisation are 

	volunteers. Real Questions is legally registered and based in Sydney, with all 

	volunteers covered by insurance.
</p>
<p>
The vision of Real Questions is to improve political accountability through presenting the concerns and questions of the public online through open processes reflecting public interest and interaction rather than political spin. We want a record of key public concerns and questions, whether or not they receive a response, engaging with all mainstream political perspectives. We also offer a way for people to ask a question of any elected politician in Australia, who will also be able to connect and respond if they choose. 
We want to develop better ways of enhancing online public conversations about key issues and questions, but we are not a chat room or political blog. We are building new ways to collect and disseminate broad input, and promote online conversation. Our focus is on ways to for people to briefly present specific concerns and identify the level of support for those concerns. Real Questions began as a website, but is evolving to an online presence accessible via social media and other online platforms. We are planning ways to enable campaigners to raise and highlight issues of concern, with questions addressed to specific politicians and key results fed back to those in the campaigns.
</p>

<h3>Who is “Real Questions?</h3>

<p>
	Real Questions is a non-profit organisation started in 2008 by Charles and David Jago, who have a 

	background of involvement in public participation and facilitation. It was legally registered as a company 

	limited by guarantee in March 2010; the ABN is 43 142 636 093. The organisation's constitution does not 

	allow paying profits to members or paying directors' fees.

	Real Questions provides ongoing training and mentoring for its technical team in Sydney. All Real 

	Questions systems are released under the open source Affero General Public license v3.

	Charles Jago is Executive Director. Technical Director Erle Pereira and Saurabh Saxena provide key 

	technical leadership. Real Questions board members include Charles Jago, David Jago, Jack Jago, Erle 

	Pereira and Saurabh Saxena. As we grow, we intend that Real Questions will be led by a board of 

	respected, transparently independent group of men and women from a range of occupational and political 

	backgrounds, Australian states and age groups. The range of experience should cover social &amp;/or political 

	participation in media and politics as well as business, information technology and project management. 

	Former elected representatives would ideally have backgrounds across multiple levels of government and 

	multiple parties, but would not be serving politicians or paid political operators. Note: Charles Jago is a 

	member of the Greens, but Real Questions is not associated with the Greens in any way. 

	Current funding comes from individual donations from the Jago family. No corporate donations are 

	accepted, although grants from non-corporate organisations such as foundations could be accepted where 

	the board believed that they did not compromise the independence of the organisation. The main costs are 

	for insurance, legal registration and accounting.
</p>

<h3>We are all volunteers!</h3>
<p>
	Real Questions has no paid staff, and relies entirely on volunteers. Also, we don't have an office. Real

	Questions operates substantially as a virtual organisation. We have volunteers mostly in Sydney, but also 

	in Brisbane. Volunteers work at homeand get together in person every week or two. We also use Skype 

	for regular meetings.
